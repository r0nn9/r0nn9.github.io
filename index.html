    <p>Soccer has <strong>never</strong> been just a sport to me. It is the one place where effort is <em>visible</em>, mistakes are immediate, and growth is <u>unavoidable</u>. Every time I step onto the field, <br>
      I am forced to confront who I am in that moment—confident or hesitant, disciplined or distracted. One of the <em>biggest</em> lessons soccer has taught me is accountability. On the field, <br>
      there is no hiding. If I lose focus, it affects the <strong>entire</strong> team. If I do not communicate, someone else pays the price. That pressure used to scare me, but over time I realized it is <br>
      also what makes soccer <em><strong>meaningful</strong></em>. It teaches me to own my actions, whether they lead to success or failure.</p>

      <p>What surprises most people is how <em>mental</em> the game really is. Physical ability matters, but mindset matters <strong>more</strong>. Confidence, composure, and trust can change the outcome of a match. <br> 
      There are games where I was not at my best physically, but mentally locked in—and those were some of my strongest performances. Soccer taught me that preparation is not just about training your body, but also training your mind. <br>
      Soccer has changed how I deal with failure. Missed chances, bad touches, and lost games are part of the sport. Early on, those moments frustrated me more than they should have. I would replay mistakes in my head instead of moving forward.
      But soccer does not allow you to dwell for long—the game keeps going. I have learned that <strong>resilience</strong> is not about avoiding mistakes, but about <em>responding to them</em> with focus and effort.</p>
